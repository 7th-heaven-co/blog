# 🎯 Staged-To-Production Workflow Breakdown

🚀 **Workflow 2: Staged to Production (staged-to-production.yml)**

📌 Trigger: Every Thursday at midnight UTC or manually
📌 Outcome:

1. 🔄 Creates a PR titled 🚀 Deploy v1.0.1 from staged → production.
2. 🤖 Auto-approves & merges the PR (ensuring at least one approval).
3. 🔄 Commits PR changes to production.
4. 🏷️ After merging, creates a Git tag (v1.0.1) for the production release.
5. 🚀 Deploys to Cloudflare Pages automatically.[^1]

🔥 Why This is the Best Approach:

- ✅ PRs are versioned → Easier tracking in GitHub.
- ✅ Git Tags are created → Clear release history in the repository.
