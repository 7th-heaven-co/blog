## About Me

Hi! I'm **Jasmine Anderson**, the creator of 7th-Heaven. My love for fantasy began in childhood with anime nights, staying up late alongside my siblings to catch the latest episodes of *Dragonball Z*. This early passion naturally evolved into a deep love for fantasy literature, particularly sparked by the magical adventures within the *Harry Potter* series, which nurtured my lifelong enthusiasm for reading.

As I grew older, the stories I imagined began to take shape, prompting me to finally put pen (or rather, hands) to keyboard. This blog is a reflection of my desire to fuse my passions—reading, writing, and technology—into a single, evolving project. It serves both as an outlet for the tales that have brewed in my imagination for decades and as a documentation of my ongoing journey to refine my storytelling and technical skills.

Beyond the keyboard, you might find me wandering local nature trails, headphones on, breathing in the fresh air, and exploring deeper into the fantasy worlds I continuously craft in my mind.
