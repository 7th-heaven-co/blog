# deploy-to-production

🎯 Final Workflow Breakdown:

1. 🔬 Runs Tests (npm test).
2. 🔢 Auto-increments the version (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.0.1).
3. 📌 Updates the VERSION file and commits it to staged.
4. 🔄 Creates a PR titled 🚀 Deploy v1.0.1 from staged → production.
5. 🤖 Auto-approves & merges the PR (ensuring at least one approval).
6. 🏷️ After merging, creates a Git tag (v1.0.1) for the release.

🔥 Why This is the Best Approach:

- ✅ PRs are versioned → Easier tracking in GitHub
- ✅ Git Tags are created → Clear release history in the repository
- ✅ Cloudflare automatically deploys → No extra deployment step needed

🚀 Now, every deployment is versioned and tagged automatically!
