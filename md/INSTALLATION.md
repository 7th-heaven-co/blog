# Installation

Follow these steps to clone and install your Astro project:

## 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone your Astro project repository. Replace `<repository-url>` with your project's URL.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

## 2. Navigate into the Project Directory

Change to the project directory that was just created:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

Astro projects typically use npm, yarn, or pnpm to manage dependencies. Choose one of the following commands based on your package manager:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn
  ```

- **Using pnpm:**

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

## 4. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

- **Using pnpm:**

  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```

This will start your Astro project locally. Typically, you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your configuration).

## 5. Build for Production (Optional)

When youâ€™re ready to build your project for production, run:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

- **Using pnpm:**

  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```
